# Contests-challenges
Done in 2017  - some C++ exercise about common algorithms and data structures that I've done for a contest

Thanks to these exercises I won a 10-weeks contest during my university career. For 10 weeks all the participants had to do 2 exercises each week-end. I still remember the nights the nights I woke up with working solutions... Wonderful.
